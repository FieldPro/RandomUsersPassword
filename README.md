Program was developed by Emmanuel Fasanya

User is asked to choose the length of the password which will be created. Length of password must be between 6 and 10. 
If user enters a number below 6 or above 10, the program will request user to re-enter number between 6 and 10.
If number of length is given, the program creates an alphanumeric password and displays it to the user.
